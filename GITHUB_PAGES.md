# GitHub Pages hosting

The privacy policy lives in `docs/index.md` and is ready for GitHub Pages using the `/docs` folder on the default branch.

1. Push the latest changes to GitHub.
2. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch** → branch **main** (or your default) → folder **/docs**, then save.
4. GitHub will build and publish. The site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` (or at your custom domain if configured).
5. Future updates: edit `docs/index.md`, commit, and push to republish.
